                   <p>IN LIGHT OF THE BENEFITS OF THE URBAN FARMS,URBAN GARDENS ARE POPPING ACROSS THE NATION.
                   But The challenges that organizers and growers face must be understood and addressed if urban gardens are to become widespread and even profitable.Several obstacles face planners and growers including:
                   soil contaminant,
                   water availability ,
                   fundings and
                   changes in climatic and atmospheric conditions.
                   
                   Further,It is observed that the study on this topic is still ongoing and expert says preliminary results are exciting they are finding that crops yield are highly variable closer to the city centre and producing higher yield in more rural areas.

                                             <h3>CONCLUSION:
</h3>                   
                 <p>  As per my view, Urban agriculture: at first glance, may appear to be a fairly simple topic: Scatter a few plots about the City and let residents start gardening. In reality, however, urban agriculture impacts a community in a variety of ways, from providing food security, environmental benefits, and even modifying a city’s urban form. Similarly, in spite of its seeming simplicity, urban agriculture does not just happen. To foster the development and growth of urban agriculture, a city may have to consider implementing techniques that include zoning ordinances, comprehensive plans and, in some cases, state legislation. The take-away lesson for us is that people’s livelihoods have to be at the center of any discussion about sustainability and making changes. At a most basic level the need to provide for oneself and one’s family is a major driver of behavior. We need to be able to recognize this tension between short-term livelihood decisions and long-term sustainability goals and forge a path that works with people’s need to provide for for their families, but does so in an environmentally and socially conscious way.
